# SubTrack – SaaS Subscription Management UI

SubTrack is a frontend-only SaaS interface designed and implemented to showcase the translation of product design into clean, maintainable code.  
The project focuses on key user-facing areas of a subscription-based product: a dashboard overview and a subscriptions management page.

This project was built as part of my portfolio to demonstrate UI design, layout structure, and frontend implementation skills.

## 🔍 Project Scope

The goal of this project was not to build a full application, but to focus on:
- Clear UI hierarchy
- Reusable components
- Responsive layouts
- Pragmatic frontend architecture

The project intentionally avoids backend logic and authentication to keep the scope focused on design and frontend implementation.

---

## 📄 Pages Implemented

- **Dashboard**
  - Overview cards (KPIs)
  - Structured layout
  - Visual hierarchy for key metrics

- **Subscriptions**
  - Table-based layout
  - Status indicators
  - Action-oriented UI
  - Clear data organization

All data is mock data and used for UI demonstration purposes only.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **Bootstrap** – layout system and components  
- **SCSS** – custom styling, variables, and overrides  
- **JavaScript** – light interactions (UI behavior only)

SCSS is used to customize and extend Bootstrap while keeping styles modular and maintainable.

## 🎨 Design to Code

The project is based on an existing product design concept and focuses on:
- Translating design decisions into real components
- Managing spacing, typography, and consistency
- Balancing aesthetics with technical feasibility

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The interface is responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile viewports.  
Responsive behavior is handled through Bootstrap’s grid system and custom SCSS adjustments.

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

With more time, the project could be extended with:
- Additional pages (payments, settings, etc.)
- More advanced interactions
- Accessibility refinements
- Integration with real data sources

## ℹ️ Notes

This project is frontend-only and intended to demonstrate UI implementation skills rather than full application logic.
